# Binary Pulse Game

This repository currently contains only the initial project structure. The
instructions below outline how a typical development setup might look when the
source code is added.

## Local Development Setup

The project uses both Node.js and Python. Install recent versions of each:

- **Node.js**: version 18 or later
- **Python**: version 3.10 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

Once dependencies are installed you can run the development server. Depending on
how the code is structured this might involve a Node script or a Python entry
point. Typical commands would be:

```bash
npm start              # if using a Node server
# or
python main.py         # if the application entry point is Python
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Version Mismatch**
  - Verify the Node.js and Python versions match the requirements above.
- **Missing Dependencies**
  - Ensure `npm install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` have been run.
- **Virtual Environment Not Activated**
  - Activate your Python virtual environment before starting the project.
- **Port Already in Use**
  - If the development server fails to start because the default port is busy,
    set an alternative port using an environment variable or configuration
    option.
